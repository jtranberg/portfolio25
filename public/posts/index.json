Today we tightened the complete path:\n\n1. **Founder Hub** (jaytranberg.com) → positioning and quick proof.\n2. **App Intelligence** → what we build and how we ship.\n3. **Portfolio** → hard evidence: metrics, projects, downloads.\n4. **LinkedIn** → social proof + contact.\n\n## What changed\n- Consistent **CTA language** and button order across pages.\n- Matching **metrics strips** (30+ shipped projects, 6 categories, CI/CD).\n- Footer links standardized, including **Founder: JayTranberg.com**.\n\n## Result\nLess friction, more signal. Visitors get the story in seconds, and every route ends in a contact surface."
